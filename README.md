* A web app to visualize various graph algorithms to find shortest path from source block to destination block.
* Source block is shown by yellow color and destination block is shown by red color
* We can create wall anywhere on the grid by simply clicking on the square block which then turns into a dark color.
* One can visualize how the algorithm and how it finds shortest path from source to destination by avoiding the walls.

Algorithms discussed:

* Djikshtra's algorithm
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
